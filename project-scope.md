# Project Overview
 We are planning to create a turn-based role playing game where a player can select actions for thier character to take against a monster. We will be keeping stats for both the hero and the monsters encountered. Each action selected by the player will impact these stats. The player will continue to select actions and battle the monster until either is defeated. 

 Features to include in our MVP:
 - Ability for the player to choose a character (warrior, ranger or mage) and name the selected character
 - Each type of hero will have four different actions/attacks
 - Allow the player to choose between fighting a monster or resting 
 - Keep track of hero stats: HP, MP EXP
 - The hero will continue to fight monsters until the hero is defeated 
 - Include some kind of leveling system
