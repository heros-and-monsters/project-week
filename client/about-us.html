      <h2>Kevin Couture</h2>
      <p>Graduated in 2018 with BS in CE and CS minor in Mathematics. Currently playing some Dota 2 when I get free time (far a few in between). I am an apprentice at Amazon hired though the Apprenti company. My favorite book right now is the “Black Company” series by Glen Cook.</p>
      <h2>Travis Cox</h2>
      <p>Travis Cox’s life philosophy is centered on the principle of accepting challenges, with this he maintains a continuous growth  and education. You should be careful asking him "Do you want to... " generally the answer will be yes before you finish the question. As long as it is a genuine challenge.</p>
      <h2>Roman Gebrehiwot</h2>
      <p>My name is Roman, this is my first team project. Is not only my first team project but my first game project which I have never played game before except Mario long time ago. I am so happy to work with my team because I learn a lot of things. If you ask me what’s my favorite game, it will be “Heroes-and-monsters” 201 project.</p>
      <h2>Jane Hur</h2>
      <p>Jane spent the past 10 years of her career working in nonprofit organizations as a web designer. She got weary of spending hours and hours each day looking for the "perfect photo" so decided to make a career switch and become a dev! Outside of her time at Codefellows, she tries to keep up with her two energetic boys along with her husband, Sam. </p>
